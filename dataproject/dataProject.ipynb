    "We have focused on making our code interactive, responsive and dynamic, meaning that the code will run independent on the stock data we load. To underline this, we include more than 20 years of data on *Apple* (AAPL), *Microsoft* (MSFT), *Boeing* (BA) and *AIG* (AIG). Furthermore, we invite you to include a stock of your own liking below – if you want. The code will run with or without the additional stock.\n",
